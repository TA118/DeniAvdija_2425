# DeniAvdija_2425

## 🎯 Project Goals

*Build a clean, structured dataset of Deni Avdija’s season.
*Explore game-by-game performance trends.
*Analyze shooting efficiency, scoring distribution, home/away splits.
*Test statistical hypotheses using SQL (Z-tests, conditional probabilities).
*Visualize results using Python and Power BI.
*Create a professional data-science project from scratch.

## 📊 Key Features

### ✔ SQL Analysis  
Inside `sql/DeniAvdija2425.sql` you will find:
*Points vs Wins analysis  
*FG% / 3PT% efficiency queries  
*Z-tests:
   *Does *3P ≥ 3* significantly increase win probability?
   *Are losses significantly more likely when opponent ≤ 100 points?
*Advanced aggregations & conditional logic

### ✔ Python Notebook  
Inside `python/DeniAvdija2425.ipynb`:
*Data cleaning & preprocessing  
*Visualizations (matplotlib / seaborn)  
*Rolling averages  
*Shooting splits  
*Opponent difficulty models  
*Logistic regression for win prediction

### ✔ Power BI Dashboard  
Inside `powerbi/Deni_Avdija_2425.pbix`:
*Game-by-game scoring trends  
*Shooting efficiency cards  
*Win/loss breakdown  
*Interactive filters  
*Visual representation of season performance

*Turnovers
*Usage rate

### 🔹 What predicts a win?
A logistic regression explores:
*Points scored  
*3PT made  
*Opponent points  
*Home/away indicator  

### 🔹 Do certain opponents cause performance dips?
Python visualizations highlight:
*Higher variance opponents
*Defensive matchups
*Trends by opponent team
